This is a modification of the best coding font out there: [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). 

However, I want font ligatures that are especially geared towards ES6 and ReactJS codes, thus this project.


#### Modified ligatures thus far:

- Curly braces
- Fat arrow 
- `React.Fragment`
- Closing tag (singular tag)
